## Files in this folder

- `data_from_source.csv` — the observations extracted from the sources for this country: the 2010-2022 records of the first release plus, since 2026-10-07, every current panel value that had no row. `used_in_panel` is recomputed from the current panel and `historical_status` says why a record is no longer used (superseded, rejected, reclassified, deleted)
- `value_check.csv` — workbook value vs live source value, where machine-checkable
- `source_manifest.csv` — every cited source and how it was retrieved
- the downloaded source documents sit directly in this folder (there is no `sources/` subfolder); each has a viewable `MIRROR__` PDF/PNG, and a `SNAPSHOT__` page extract where one was cut out
